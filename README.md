## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. You can use tools like **Insomnia**, **Postman**, or **cURL** to send requests to the API endpoints.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:
```
    GET /products: Get all products.
    GET /products/:id: Get a single product by ID.
    POST /products: Create a new product.
    PUT /products/:id: Update an existing product.
    DELETE /products/:id: Delete a product by ID.
```

These endpoints can be used for `/api/products`, `/api/categories`, and `/api/tags`
